## The Problem

- Realm of Real Estate is highly dependent on estimation of property prices , both property owners and real estate agents are required to have a good estimation for getting the best deal for the property they own or the property they wanna buy.
- In this problem we deal with creating a robust machine learning model for house prices prediction for California with a satisfactory precision.

## Understanding The Data

- You can download the dataset from Kaggle
[Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
- Import the data
  
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  
  def load_housing_data(housing_path=HOUSING_PATH): #Path to your dataset
      csv_path = os.path.join(housing_path, "housing.csv")
      return pd.read_csv(csv_path)
  ```
- Load and Eyeball the data
  
  ```python
  df = load_housing_data()
  df.head()
  ```
